# Pinboard Button

A very minimal Firefox extension for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) that doesn't use API keys, instead just opens Pinboard windows.

The Pinboard Button opens a small menu that let's you:

	- Save the current page to Pinboard
	- Open your unread Pinboard bookmarks
	- Open all your Pinboard bookmarks

The extension also has a keyboard shortcut to quickly save to Pinboard: `Alt+P`.

[Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pinboard-popup/) it in the Firefox Add-ons website.
