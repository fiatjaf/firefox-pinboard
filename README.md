# Pinboard Button

A very minimal Firefox extension for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) that doesn't use API keys, instead just opens Pinboard windows.

The Pinboard Button opens a small menu that let's you:

- Save the current page to your Pinboard
- Save the current page to your Pinboard's "to read" list
- Open your unread Pinboard bookmarks
- Open all your Pinboard bookmarks

The extension also provides keyboard shortcuts to:

- Save to Pinboard: `Alt+P`.
- Save to Read Later: `Alt+R`.

[Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pinboard-button/) it in the Firefox Add-ons website.
